# [Musical Garden](https://musical-garden.netlify.app/)

This web instrument allows you to make music by planting and watering different kinds of “audio seeds” that grow into lush melodies and textures.

Watering the seeds causes them to grow both visually and sonically, and distinct areas in the garden cause the plants to behave in different ways.

Composing using this interface is more spacial than linear. Plants emanate sound that you navigate through using the mouse, so moving through the space influences the mix of sounds.

The implementation represents different types of sound using basic geometric forms and generates growth patterns algorithmically using L-Systems — a way of modeling generational systems. These patterns are at times also used to produce melodies.

The musical garden invites exploration, and can be found at https://musical-garden.netlify.app/
